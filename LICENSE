   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. In these Terms of Use (as defined below) the following definitions shall apply:
  1.1. “IOGP” means the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, incorporated in England as a company limited by guarantee (number 1832064);
  1.2. “GIGS” means the Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software testing framework, published by IOGP, incorporating the GIGS Software;
  1.3. “GIGS Software” means the associated elements and contributions of the GIGS framework, including but not limited to: the GIGS Website, the GIGS Test Dataset files, the GIGS Test Series files and the GIGS Documentation;
  1.4. “GIGS Website” means the online portal serving all GIGS Software hosted by IOGP and currently available at https://www.gigs.iogp.org;
  1.5. “GIGS Test Dataset” means the collection of files that contain reference data and source code associated with GIGS Tests;
  1.6. “GIGS Test Series” means the compilation of recommended GIGS Tests pertaining to specific technical themes, as recommended by IOGP;
  1.7. “GIGS Tests” means the specific procedures that involve testing certain functions within a digital application;
  1.8. “GIGS Documentation” means the reports published by IOGP associated with undertaking a GIGS Evaluation;
  1.9. “GIGS Evaluation” means the process of executing GIGS testing and applying all/some of the GIGS Software to a specific digital application in order to generate a GIGS Score; and
  1.10. “GIGS Score” means the calculated level and percentage score that determines the level of conformance of the digital application being tested; and
  1.11. "Terms of Use" means these terms and conditions governing the use of the GIGS Software and GIGS Website.

2. The GIGS Software are published via the GIGS Website by IOGP at no charge. Distribution for profit is forbidden. The GIGS Software and GIGS Website remain proprietary to IOGP.

3. The GIGS Software components are compiled by the GIGS User Group, of IOPG, from publicly available and IOGP member-supplied information.

4. The GIGS Test Dataset is comprised entirely of synthetic data generated for testing purposes only and any resemblance to “real world” or otherwise proprietary datasets is purely coincidental. The selection of geodetic entities within the GIGS Test Dataset is designed to be as wide-ranging as possible and does not represent IOGPs interest, affiliation or alignment with any particular organisation or geography.

5. IOGP reserve the right to modify, update or remove the GIGS Software at any time and without notice.

6. he calculation and provision of a GIGS Score as a result of undertaking a GIGS Evaluation does not in any way provide an endorsement for the application in question by IOGP and IOGP accepts no responsibility for the effects of calculating such GIGS Score.

7. IOGP does not warrant that the GIGS Software will meet the full requirements of any particular testing framework and does not guarantee that the GIGS Test Series and GIGS Test Dataset will capture all facets of geodetic and geospatial integrity within a digital application. The completion of a GIGS Evaluation does not in any way therefore deem a digital application to be of a certain quality.

8. The GIGS Software may be used, copied and distributed subject to the following conditions:
  8.1. DATA AND INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE GIGS SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;

Consequently, such use is at your own risk. You are obliged to inform anyone to whom you provide the GIGS Software of these Terms of Use;
  8.3. The GIGS Test Series and GIGS Test Dataset may be implemented in any commercial package provided that any commerciality is based on value added by the provider and not on a value ascribed to the GIGS Software which is made available at no charge;
  8.4. Ownership of the GIGS Software by IOGP must be acknowledged in any publication or transmission (by whatever means) thereof (including permitted modifications); and
  8.5. No data that has been modified other than as permitted in these Terms of Use shall be attributed to the GIGS Software.
